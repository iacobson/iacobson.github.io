title: An easy way to add tags to your Github hosted Jekyll blog
tags: ["jekyll", "jquery"]
excerpt: "Using jQuery to manage the Jekyll tag filters may not be the most elegant solution, but is quite easy to implement, and works well."

Have you tried to add tags to your Jekyll powered static blog? Probably you saw there is no easy, out of the box solution to make it work (or at least I did not find one). Here I need to make 2 remarks:  
- by "make it work" I mean you should be able not only to display the tags on the post, but be able to click on any of them and get the complete list of the posts marked with this tag  
- I've not considered any Jekyll [plugin](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/){:target="_blank"} that is not compatible with Github hosting, so there may be some other solutions if you don't host your blog on Github.
